# Photo-Collage-Maker-using-Python

# Introduction
Hello Curious Coders,

In this Project we are going to discuss how to form a collage of images using python. The Photo Collage is a group of multiple photographs or images arranged and displayed together in a single composition. The PIL packeg is used to generate a collage in Python as followsâ€¦.

# Code Explanation
First we imported required PIL package
Later using Image.open() fucntion we are going to open images. 
Using Image.resize() fucntion we resized images to same resolution to ensure collage looks good.
Next we created a simple image using Image.new() function which is able to store all the opened images.
Finally using Image.save() function we saved our image(Photo_Collage.png)
